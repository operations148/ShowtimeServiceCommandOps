# ServiceOps Command Center — Project Handoff

_Generated: 2026-06-11. This document is the single source of truth for a new Claude session to continue development with zero prior context._

---

## What This Project Is

ServiceOps Command Center is a GHL-integrated work order and field operations SaaS, built first for **Showtime Pool Service** (California). It plugs into GoHighLevel via webhooks and private integration API to receive job-ready data, create work orders, route jobs to field technicians, and push status updates back to GHL when a job is completed or an estimate is needed. The long-term vision is a white-label Jobber-style add-on sold to local service businesses (pool service, HVAC, landscaping, plumbing) already using GoHighLevel. The app is **live in production** at `https://serviceops-ghl-workorders.vercel.app`.

- **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/Eriin2816/service-command-ops.git
- **Client repo (Markate expansion)**: https://github.com/operations148/ShowtimeServiceCommandOps
- **Production URL**: https://serviceops-ghl-workorders.vercel.app
- **Project root**: `serviceops-ghl-workorders-scaffold/serviceops-ghl-workorders/`

## Markate-Inspired Expansion Status (read this first — newer than the sections below)

The July 2026 expansion (phased plan in `docs/implementation/master-plan.md`) supersedes the older status sections in this document where they conflict. Nothing below this section has been rewritten; trust `MEMORY.md` rows 21-23 and the phase memory files for current truth.

| Phase | Status | Branch | Key artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Repository audit | ✅ 2026-07-11 | `feat/phase-0-audit` | `docs/audits/*`, `docs/implementation/master-plan.md`, `memory/phase-0-audit.md` |
| 1 — Security/tenancy/authorization foundation | ✅ 2026-07-11 | `feat/serviceops-phase-1-security` | `docs/security/security-controls.md`, ADR-0002/3/4, `qa/security-test-plan.md` |
| 2 — Core data model, money, pricebook | ✅ 2026-07-11 | `feat/serviceops-phase-2-pricebook` | `src/lib/money/`, `document_sequences`, pricebook (API + `/dashboard/pricebook`), ADR-0005/6, `specs/pricebook.md`, `docs/architecture/target-state.md` |
| 3 — Full estimates/proposals/secure approval | ✅ 2026-07-12 | `feat/serviceops-phase-3-estimates` | `src/lib/estimates/*`, estimates tables, `/dashboard/estimates` + `/estimate/[token]`, ADR-0007/8, `specs/estimates.md`, `database-blueprint/estimates.md` |
| 4 — Dispatch, calendar, visit admin, recurring | ✅ 2026-07-12 | `feat/serviceops-phase-4-dispatch` | `src/lib/scheduling/*`, scheduling tables, `/dashboard/schedule` + `/dashboard/visits`, ADR-0009, `specs/dispatch-and-scheduling.md`, `docs/operations/recurring-job-runbook.md` |
| 5 — Work-order expansion, multi-visit projects, change orders | ✅ 2026-07-13 | `feat/serviceops-phase-5-work-orders` | 11-state WO lifecycle + archive/close/reopen, parent/child projects, tasks/attachments, checklist templates + immutable completion snapshots, tenant completion-requirement gate, full change-order workflow (`/dashboard/change-orders/[id]` + `/change-order/[token]`), ADR-0010/11, `specs/work-order-projects.md`, `specs/change-orders.md`, `database-blueprint/change-orders.md`, `memory/phase-5-work-orders-change-orders.md` |
| 6 — Invoices, Stripe Connect payments, ledger, reconciliation | ✅ **merged + deployed** 2026-07-14 (Stripe keys deferred) | `feat/serviceops-phase-6-invoices-payments` → master | 12-state invoice machine, immutable payment ledger (ADR-0012), Stripe Connect Express/direct-charge + server-owned amounts (ADR-0013), webhook rewrite (verify + terminal/transient split), public pay page `/invoice/[token]`, admin invoices UI `/dashboard/invoices`, reconciliation cron+admin, `specs/invoices-and-payments.md`, `database-blueprint/payments.md`, `docs/operations/stripe-runbook.md`, `qa/payments-test-plan.md`, `memory/phase-6-invoices-payments.md`. Migration `20260714000001` **applied to prod**. **Remaining**: set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (test keys) + create the Stripe webhook endpoint to enable card payment. |
| 7 — Secure tenant-branded customer portal | ✅ code-complete 2026-07-16 (branch, **not merged/deployed**) | `feat/serviceops-phase-7-customer-portal` | Separate `portal_customers` identity + passwordless magic-link (hashed/one-time/scanner-safe) + DB-backed revocable sessions re-validated per request, property-scoped authz reusing existing accept/decline/pay verbs, customer UI `/portal/*`, admin `/dashboard/portal-users` gated by new `canManagePortalUsers`, no-store cache policy + PWA manifest, ADR-0014, `specs/customer-portal.md`, `database-blueprint/customer-portal.md`, `docs/security/portal-security.md`, `qa/customer-portal-test-plan.md`, `memory/phase-7-customer-portal.md`. **To deploy**: merge→master, apply migration `20260715000001` (no new secret). |

**Migration-history hotfixes applied to production this session** (both hand-added columns never captured in tracked migrations, breaking a from-migrations DB): `users.avatar_url` (`20260714000002` — was breaking login) and `tenants.logo_url` (`20260714000003` — breaks company settings + document-send branding). The production DB (`yyjbfjnpmjcraehecbvi`) now has Phases 0–6 applied + these two hotfixes; Phase 7's `20260715000001` is NOT yet applied.

**Standing facts a new session must know** (details in `docs/architecture/target-state.md`):
- All money math goes through `src/lib/money/money.ts` (integer cents); document numbers through `nextDocumentNumber()` — never `COUNT(*)+1`. Document line items are immutable snapshots (`createLineItemSnapshot`); estimate/invoice totals are computed server-side from selected lines and never trusted from the client.
- `src/types/invoice.ts` is the ONLY invoice model; `src/types/estimate.ts` is now the REAL migrated estimate document model (Phase 3), not the old dead file (which was deleted in Phase 2).
- `internal_cost`/`unit_cost` are server-redacted for roles without `canViewItemCosts`; the public estimate route redacts via an allowlist type (`PublicEstimate`) so internal fields structurally cannot leak.
- Estimate customer emails are gated: `ESTIMATE_EMAIL_MODE` defaults to `preview` (no real send). `live` is the external-action approval gate. Public estimate links use a hashed token (ADR-0007).
- Migrations `20260711000001`/`0002`/`0003` and `20260712000001` are written but **not applied to the live DB** — application requires explicit approval.
- Every authenticated request re-validates auth against the DB via the trusted context (`src/lib/auth/trusted-context.ts`); rate limiting and the GHL sync retry queue are Postgres-backed. The public estimate routes are the only unauthenticated surface (token is the credential).
- **All schedule time math goes through `src/lib/scheduling/timezone.ts`** — UTC storage, tenant-local display (`tenants.timezone`), calendar dates as strings. GHL owns the original booking; ServiceOps owns operational scheduling/dispatch (ADR-0009). Recurring generation is idempotent (duplicate-proof via `UNIQUE(recurring_schedule_id, scheduled_date)`) and observable (`cron_runs`).

## Tech Stack Confirmed

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 15, App Router, TypeScript strict — no Pages Router ever |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL (service role key, app-layer tenant isolation) |
| Auth | NextAuth.js v4 — CredentialsProvider + bcrypt + Supabase `users` table, JWT strategy, 8h sessions |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS only — no inline styles. `Sora` (headings) + `Plus Jakarta Sans` (body) via `next/font/google` |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Class utility | `cn()` from `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` — lives in `src/lib/utils/index.ts` |
| Email | Resend (`src/lib/email/resend.ts`) |
| PDF | pdfkit — server-side, Node.js native, listed in `serverExternalPackages` |
| Charts | recharts |
| Payments | Stripe — packages installed (`stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`), **not yet wired** |
| PWA | next-pwa (installed) |
| Validation | Zod v4 — schemas in `src/lib/validation/` |
| Deployment | Vercel |
| GHL Integration | Private Integration Token (NOT OAuth, NOT marketplace app) |

| **In Progress** | Updates WO status → `in_progress` |
| **Completed/Won** | Updates WO status → `completed`, pushes `PUT /opportunities/{id} { status: "won" }` to GHL |

### Outbound Sync (ServiceOps → GHL)

| Trigger | GHL Action | File |
|---------|-----------|------|
| WO status → `completed` | `PUT /opportunities/{id}` with `{ status: "won" }` | `src/lib/ghl/sync-completion.ts` |

## Features In Progress 🔄

1. **Stripe Payments** — packages installed (`stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`). No API routes, webhooks, or UI wired yet. Env vars missing. This is the next logical phase.

2. **ContactCreate/ContactUpdate webhook handlers** — Only `OpportunityStatusChange` is wired. `ContactCreate`/`ContactUpdate` → property upsert (`src/lib/ghl/upsert-property-from-ghl.ts` exists but not called from webhook dispatch).

3. **AppointmentBooked webhook handler** — `src/lib/ghl/create-work-order-from-appointment.ts` exists but not connected to webhook dispatch.

4. **GHL retry queue persistence** — `src/lib/ghl/retry-queue.ts` is in-memory only. Lost on server restart. Needs backing by `work_order_sync_queue` DB table or Redis before production is reliable.

5. **`ghl_sync_failed` flag in UI** — The flag is set on `work_orders` when GHL sync fails after retries, but it is not yet surfaced as a warning badge in the admin dashboard.

6. **AI Knowledge Base** — `/dashboard/ai-knowledge/page.tsx` is a stub/placeholder page.

---

## Features Planned But Not Started ⏳

- Multi-tenant SaaS hardening (onboarding flow, tenant isolation for new signups)
- White-label tenant billing (Stripe subscription per tenant)
- GHL Marketplace App listing (OAuth flow instead of private token)
- Route optimization / dispatch board
- Customer-facing portal
- Native mobile apps
- AI voice (GHL missed-call text-back style)
- Inventory management
- Comprehensive invoicing module
- Automated review request trigger (job complete → GHL automation)

---

## Current Bugs / Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Retry queue is in-memory only | Medium | `src/lib/ghl/retry-queue.ts` — items lost on restart. Won't affect correctness if app stays warm, but could lose sync events under cold starts |
| `waitUntil()` not added to fire-and-forget GHL calls | Low | In serverless, the PATCH response returns before GHL sync completes. Works now, but could be truncated under load. Add `waitUntil(syncCompletionToGhl(...))` in PATCH route |
| `ghl_sync_failed` not surfaced in UI | Low | Flag is stored on `work_orders` but no admin alert shown |
| ContactCreate/ContactUpdate webhooks not handled | Medium | Properties must be manually created or imported; GHL contact webhooks are ignored |
| AI Knowledge Base page is a stub | Low | `/dashboard/ai-knowledge` renders a placeholder |

## Build Order Remaining

1. **Wire ContactCreate/ContactUpdate webhooks** — `upsert-property-from-ghl.ts` exists; add cases to webhook dispatch switch in `src/app/api/ghl/webhooks/route.ts`

2. **Wire AppointmentBooked webhook** — `create-work-order-from-appointment.ts` exists; add case to dispatch switch

3. **Persist GHL retry queue** — Replace in-memory `retry-queue.ts` with a `work_order_sync_queue` DB table (add migration); write a cron job to drain it

4. **Surface `ghl_sync_failed` in admin UI** — Add a warning badge to `WorkOrderDetail.tsx` when `ghl_sync_failed === true`

5. **Stripe integration** — Add env vars (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`), create `/api/stripe/webhook` route, wire Stripe in settings for tenant billing

6. **Complete estimates workflow** — Estimates page (`EstimatesPageClient.tsx`) needs send/approve/decline actions fully wired to Supabase

7. **QA pass** — Test all role permission scenarios, test GHL webhook with live Showtime payloads, test on actual mobile device, tenant isolation test with two test tenants

8. **Multi-tenant onboarding** — New tenant signup flow, GHL location mapping UI, tenant billing via Stripe

---

## Critical Rules (Never Break These)

### Product Boundaries
- **Do NOT rebuild GHL CRM features** — no contacts, conversations, SMS/email, pipeline management, calendars, forms, or marketing automations
- ServiceOps starts AFTER a lead becomes job-ready (Appointment Booked or Opportunity stage change)
- Before adding any feature: ask "Does GHL already do this?" — if yes, integrate instead of build

### GHL Integration Rules
- GHL is source of truth for contacts — reference by `ghl_contact_id` only, never store full contact records
- **Never hardcode GHL API tokens or credentials** — always from `process.env`
- Always verify webhook signatures (HMAC or Bearer) before processing
- Handle GHL API errors gracefully — never block job completion on GHL being down
- `GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` must never be placed in a GHL workflow config or public-facing config
- Test with sandbox/sub-account before connecting to client's live GHL

### Coding Standards
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`
- Next.js App Router only — no Pages Router
- Tailwind CSS only — no inline styles, no custom CSS unless unavoidable
- All API routes: call `getTenantId(auth.session)` immediately after auth — never use `session.user.tenant_id` directly
- Pass `tenantId` to every store/DB query function — `tenant_id` on every database query
- Zod validation on all API inputs
- UUID for all primary keys
- Soft delete only (`is_active = false`) — never hard-delete properties, users, etc.
- `WORK_ORDER_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` in `src/types/work-order.ts` — use for transition validation everywhere, never hardcode elsewhere

### Auth Rules
- Auth required on ALL non-public API routes — call `requireApiAuth()` or `requirePermission()`
- TECHNICIAN role auto-scoped to own jobs only — check `isTechnicianScoped(session)` in list endpoints
- Route protection enforced in `src/middleware.ts` — TECHNICIAN → `/tech/today`; Admin/Staff → `/dashboard/overview`

### Security Rules
- Never hardcode API keys, secrets, or tokens in code
- Log security events (failed auth, invalid webhook signatures) via `console.warn`
- PII (customer names, addresses, phones) handled carefully
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-side only — never import `src/lib/db/client.ts` in client components

### Documentation Rules
- Update `MEMORY.md` and `memory/` files after every major decision
- Write spec in `specs/` before building a new feature
- Document schema changes in `database-blueprint/` before creating migrations
- Document GHL integration changes in `integration-blueprint/` before coding

---

## How to Continue Building

1. **Read these files first** (every session):
   - `CLAUDE.md` — project rules and product boundaries
   - `MEMORY.md` — full technical history and confirmed decisions
   - `SETUP_NOTES.md` — env var status and GHL integration guide

2. **Local dev setup**:
   ```bash
   cd serviceops-ghl-workorders-scaffold/serviceops-ghl-workorders
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill values from Vercel dashboard
   # Set APP_ENV=development locally
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **DB changes**: always create a new migration file in `supabase/migrations/` with format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`. Run via Supabase dashboard or Supabase CLI.

4. **API routes pattern**:
   ```ts
   const auth = await requireApiAuth();          // or requirePermission("canXxx")
   if (!auth.ok) return auth.response;
   const tenantId = getTenantId(auth.session);   // throws if tenant_id missing
   // ... use tenantId in every DB call
   ```

5. **Auth users** are in the Supabase `users` table — `password_hash` field (bcrypt). Create users via Supabase dashboard SQL or a seed script. Demo: `admin@showtime.local` / `admin2024`, `tech@showtime.local` / `tech2024`.

6. **GHL webhook testing**: use `scripts/test-ghl-webhook.sh` — signs payloads with `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` via `openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac`.

7. **Print/typecheck before committing**: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint`

---

## Next Prompt to Run

Paste this to start the next session:

```
Read CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, SETUP_NOTES.md, and HANDOFF.md first.

The app is live at https://serviceops-ghl-workorders.vercel.app.
Client is Showtime Pool Service (California). GHL Private Integration Token is set.
All Supabase migrations have been applied. Auth uses NextAuth v4 + bcrypt + Supabase users table.

Current priorities:
1. Wire the ContactCreate and ContactUpdate GHL webhook events — the handler file 
   `src/lib/ghl/upsert-property-from-ghl.ts` already exists but is not called from 
   the dispatch switch in `src/app/api/ghl/webhooks/route.ts`.

2. Wire the AppointmentBooked webhook event — 
   `src/lib/ghl/create-work-order-from-appointment.ts` exists but not connected.

3. Replace the in-memory GHL retry queue (`src/lib/ghl/retry-queue.ts`) with a 
   DB-backed queue (new Supabase migration + cron drain route).

Before building anything, confirm my understanding of the current webhook dispatch 
switch, show me the existing handler files, and propose the implementation plan.
Do not code until I confirm the plan.
```

## Open Questions (Unresolved)

1. Which GHL plan does Showtime Pool Service use? (affects API rate limits)
2. Photo storage: Supabase Storage is wired — confirm client is OK with Supabase for photo hosting
3. Recurring visits: internal cron scheduler is wired — confirm if GHL calendar sync is also needed
4. Estimate handoff: current flow creates a GHL *task* — does client want a pipeline stage change instead?
5. GHL custom field IDs for `gate_code`, `access_notes`, `service_notes`, `scheduled_date`, `service_category`, `priority` — must retrieve from client's GHL account for ContactCreate webhook handler
6. GHL calendar ID → service category mapping for AppointmentBooked events (`GHL_CALENDAR_TO_SERVICE_CAT` env map)
7. Does the client want customer email/SMS notifications via GHL when a job is completed?
8. How many technician accounts need to be seeded in the Supabase `users` table?
